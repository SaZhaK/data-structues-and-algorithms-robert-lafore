# Data structures and algorithms

## Description
Implementation of algorithms and data structures from the book "Data structures & algorithms in Java" by Robert Lafore

## Repository structure
- The "Algorithms" package contains a set of commonly used algorithms
- The "Structures" package contains a set of packages each itself containing an implementation of a commonly used data structure and some corresponding test cases

## Intentions
This repository was implemented during studying of "Data structures & algorithmins in Java" by Robert Lafore
