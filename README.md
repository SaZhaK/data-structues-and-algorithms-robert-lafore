# Data structures and algorithms

## Description
Implementation of algorithms and data structures from the book "Data structures & algorithms in Java" by Robert Lafore

## Repository structure

### The "Algorithms" package contains a set of commonly used algorithms
- Hanoi tower
- Classic merge sort
- Reverse polish notation
- Correct brackets sequence

### The "Structures" package contains a set of packages each itself containing an implementation of a commonly used data structure and some corresponding test cases
- All common linear structures
- Graph
- Matrix
- Hashtable
- Heap
- Binary tree
- Haffman tree
- AVL tree
- Red-black tree
- B-tree (2-3-tree)
- B-tree (2-3-4-tree)

## Intentions
This repository was implemented during studying of "Data structures & algorithmins in Java" by Robert Lafore
